		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>
			Let me start by introducing myself-my name is Nadia Abby.  If I had to describe myself I would use two words, "humbly-confident" aspiring Web Developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The journey I have taken to become a Web Developer is rooted in my desire for professional and personal, and give back to the many communities I am a member of.  In the future I would love to create applications for individuals/families affected by Autism.  In addition, to serving the Autism community, I would like to create coding programs for the underprivilaged giving them skill to survive the technology age.    
		</p>

		<p>
			I am currently attending Georgia Tech's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.  If I speak honestly I started this program as someone aspiring to become a web developer.  Fast forward, just 4 weeks into the program...I am a Developer.  Prior to this course, I had only been self-teaching myself for little over a month. Throughout most of this course,  my brain feels like its going to explode and the never-ending feeling of doubt stays with me. Accompanying, all those feelings is the constant desire to learn more.   
		</p>
		<p>
			I am excited about my new career and look forward to creating new and innovative applications.
